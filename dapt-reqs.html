      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>W3C members have identified the need for a profile of TTML for the exchange of timed text content
          in the context of audio description or dubbing applications.
          This document is based on the work of the
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/audio-description/">Audio Description Community Group</a>
          and on member publications [2].</p>

        <h2>Workflow</h2>
        <p>The following diagram illustrates a hypothetical combined workflow
          for the authoring and exchange of timed text content
          for each of
          1) audio description and
          2) dubbing applications.</p>
        <p>The blue rectangles with labels preceded by a number represent various manual or automated processes.
           Processes specific to Audio Description or Dubbing workflows are marked respectively with AD or DUB.
           Those not marked as AD or DUB are common to both workflows.
           The green boxes with a wave underside represent timed text scripts produced by the various processes
           and expected to be compliant to the profile definition.
           The white boxes with a wave underside are media data used or produced in the workflows
           but whose format is out of scope for the profile.</p>
